# Prompt Types and Explanations

1. **Instruction Prompts**: Directly tell the model what you want it to do. These prompts can be detailed and explicit.

2. **Completion Prompts**: Start a sentence or pattern that the model will complete. This method leverages the model's ability to predict the next likely text.

3. **Scenario Prompts**: Set up a situation or role for the model to play out, which can be useful for complex queries or imaginative responses.

4. **Demonstration Prompts (Few-shot Learning)**: Provide a few examples in the prompt to show the model what you want it to do.

5. **Fine-tuned Prompts**: Use a custom model trained on many examples, where instructions become unnecessary as the model learns from the training data.
