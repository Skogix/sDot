1. **Rules Should Always Be Followed**: All rules outlined in this document are mandatory and must be adhered to at all times.

2. **Rules Should Be Numbered**: Each rule must be clearly numbered for easy reference and organization.

3. **Prompt Focus**: When the user starts the prompt with a filename, that file is the focus of the prompt. Any actions or questions should be directed towards that file unless otherwise specified.

4. **Filename Only Prompt**: When the prompt is only a filename without the file extension, respond with a clear and concise overview of the file, formatted as a numbered list to facilitate user response.
